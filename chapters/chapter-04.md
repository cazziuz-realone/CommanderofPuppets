# Chapter 4: Learning the System

I decided extra supplies would be smart today, so I picked up two large water skins from the market along with another fish and some fruit.

"Just a few more days and I'll be into the big money from the second dungeon," I sighed, packing my meals into inventory.

Walking a new route to the dungeon to learn more of the city, I discovered the cafe offered bagged lunches for the same four copper as the dinner special. I'd do that tomorrow—better food to keep me going.

Today's first dungeon really dragged. I realized that three days in a row was the most I'd worked or even gone to school since becoming a teenager. I'd always blamed my poor health, but the drinking was what really kept me from holding a job.

But I got through it. And another after a lunch break in the grass by the dungeon entrance—a popular spot for dungeon crawlers to eat.

"I'm level 8 now, almost to 9. Tomorrow should get me to 10, when I can enter the second dungeon. Then the big money."

The people around me chuckled at my optimism. They knew way more about the second dungeon than I did.

I looked through the passive traits section of my character sheet while eating—something I rarely bothered with since they didn't change or affect most gameplay. Humans got a small accuracy buff with blades, and there were everyday skills at low levels. Wait, the cooking passive had rankings, so it could actually level up. At high levels it would give extra dexterity. Forget it—not worth the effort for two DEX.

I hadn't really paid attention to my character sheet since arriving here. The level-up notifications didn't mention anything important, so it seemed irrelevant. But today, I noticed possibly the most important detail of all.

**[Stats]** +40  
**[STR]** 5  
**[DEX]** 5  
**[CON]** 10  
**[INT]** 5  
**[HP]** 40  
**[MP]** 50  
**[AC]** 0

"What's that plus forty?" I wondered. "Don't tell me stats aren't class-locked in this game?"

I clicked on the number and got a notification: **[Molded Like Clay]** Class Passive Allows Stats To Be Reallocated.

I quickly switched to the passive tab. Two entries under class passive: **[Molded Like Clay]** and **[Strength In Numbers]**, which gave me and my party a twenty percent increase in experience gained for every party member within fifty meters, including constructs.

So this wasn't actually a DPS class at all. I'd luckily rolled a hidden support class. That would help me find companions later when I needed a group.

But when would I get more golems? Level 10. Perfect. First though, what to do with those stat points?

**[Summon Lesser Golem]** got stronger with my Strength and tougher with my Constitution, so I decided to split them evenly.

**[Stats]**  
**[STR]** 25  
**[DEX]** 5  
**[CON]** 30  
**[INT]** 5  
**[HP]** 120  
**[MP]** 50  
**[AC]** 0

"There, much better. The golems should be stronger and I can take way more hits." I was pretty proud of myself for figuring out the problem with my character in only two days. Not that any other class would have had that problem.

Time to get back. With only a level and change to go, maybe I could get there today and hit the second dungeon tomorrow after upgrading gear?

As I approached the entrance, I saw the well-dressed guy who'd been power-leveling yesterday.

"Excuse me, do you have an open spot? You're doing power-leveling, right?"

"Five silver a run. I get the loot, you supply buffs if your class can." He smiled. Five silver was as much as a party normally made in a run, so he'd make triple while others paid.

"Sure, I'll buy in for two runs," I said, eager to pay if it meant hitting level 10 tonight in time to upgrade gear.

I had to run to keep up with the party. The other customer was a rogue with high dexterity and equally high movement speed. But the run took only fifteen minutes.

"Hey, what's this buff **[Stronger In Numbers]**?" the group leader asked.

"Wow, one hundred percent more experience gained? I'm almost to level 11 just from that run!" the rogue announced.

I was sure the buff had dropped during part of the run when my slower golems got too far behind. No matter.

"It's my class skill," I told them. "Twenty percent per group member with no listed cap."

"That's handy. But you might want to set that to hidden in the future. If unsavory groups find out, they'll make your life hell unless you grind with them all day, every day."

"Yeah, even I don't want to let you go, and we're just grinding the first dungeon. Imagine how good this would be if they tied you up and dragged you through something much tougher to power-level their guild members?" the rogue added.

That could really suck. I quickly went to the menu and found I could hide or disable the passive. Hide was the obvious choice—I wasn't quite level 10 yet.

"So, second run? Then I've got to go get some armor for tomorrow."

"Here, a refund for the buff," the group leader said, handing back my silver. "Thanks for helping level up my guild mate. I'd gladly invite you, but we're member-capped until we get the guild level up."

"No, I should thank you. I didn't think I'd have time for another run today. My golems deal most of my damage, and they can barely keep up with your movement speed." I laughed watching my stumpy little golems struggling to keep pace.

The second run was as fast as the first, bringing me smoothly to level 10—minimum entry level for the second dungeon. Mission accomplished. I waved goodbye to the guild group and ran straight for the armorer, even putting my new skill points into dexterity for increased run speed.

There was a wide variety of items to choose from, but with my limited budget, I couldn't go overboard. No wonder others took longer and had more money at low levels—my skill had been pushing me far faster than most.

I settled on a chain vest, new shirt, leather pants, and boots. Used up most of my available funds, but brought me much more security. No matter—I'd make it back tomorrow.
