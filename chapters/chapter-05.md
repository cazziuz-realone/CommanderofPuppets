# Chapter 5: Reality Check

With my new gear, I was getting pretty confident about making big money in the second dungeon. I didn't really want to share loot with anyone, so I planned to try the first run solo. After all, at level 10 I got a third golem from my **[Summon Lesser Golem]** spell.

The upgrade increased mana cost—it took most of my mana to activate now—but that was fine. They were tough. I wouldn't have to refresh them often.

When I arrived at the lineup though, other groups were clearly laughing at me.

"I don't know what's so funny," I mumbled as the gate guard waved me through with a smirk.

I summoned my golems and waited ten seconds for my mana to recover. Now I was ready to face the dungeon.

The first pull was three goblins. Easy. I sent my golems in to attack and the little green monsters were quickly occupied—easy targets for my arrows. The goblins dropped in only a few hits, and I moved on to find a dire wolf with two goblins.

The fight had just started when the wolf howled, pulling in groups from both sides. I was trapped, forced to fight in melee. The dire wolves were big, and I needed breathing room, so I tried calling my golems back, only to find them trapped too.

That's when things went wrong. A hit to the side knocked me over, forcing me back while firing poison arrows at the dire wolves. But they didn't charge me—they turned on the golems. All three went down quickly with attacks to the back, leaving me alone without the mana to summon them right away.

"Potion, get my health back and buy time," I thought, retreating.

**[Only Available Under Level 10]**

Oh no. The newbie potions didn't work anymore. I was below half health, but I had almost enough mana to bring the golems back. I just couldn't fire any arrows until then.

I'd retreated almost to the entrance when I could finally bring back the golems. They staged a valiant effort, dropping all but one dire wolf and a few goblins before being destroyed. A notification informed me of a blue quality weapon drop, and I decided it was best to live to fight another day.

I jumped back out the portal, knocking over the incoming group to uproarious laughter.

"Get anything good, rookie?" The warrior I'd knocked over asked with a smile.

I nodded. "New sword."

A large man in shining armor put a hand on my shoulder, healing me. "You can enter at level 10, but the wolves are level 20, the goblins 15." The paladin laughed. "Now that you know, go have breakfast and find a group if you want to hunt here."

That advice sounded good. I stumbled toward the cafe in humiliation. Experience dropped off hard at level 10 in the first dungeon, but I couldn't do the second alone. What would I do? Get stuck grinding in the rookie area?

My meatloaf was almost done when the healer from the other day came in with her party.

"I know we need more crowd control for that last pull," Mikia said to her tank, "but that's not something I can do. I'm squishy with not a lot of HP. I can't hold them and I'm not fast enough to make them chase me."

This was a good chance. I knew their healer, so maybe they'd take me on despite them all being over level 20 except Mikia.

"Did you guys need one more? I can summon three golems that can hold monsters, at least most of them."

"Didn't you just get wiped in there?" the shorter mage asked.

"Well, yeah, but that was solo. With a group supporting them, they can take the beating." What I didn't mention was that another four people would add another eighty percent experience, making this trip very worthwhile.

"Tell you what—you can be our off-tank to the first boss. If it works, you can finish with us. If not, we'll kick you. That work?"

"Yeah, that's fine." I shrugged, certain I'd be fine with this extra help.

Once everyone had eaten, we headed back to the dungeon. The first few packs were easy—warriors get Shield Bash at level 10, which stuns monsters for a few seconds, preventing the wolves from calling for help.

Everything was smooth to the first boss: a huge hobgoblin with two goblin commander sidekicks.

"Take the two commanders while we down the boss. Without their help, we've got this," the tank said. His name tag read GregGreg, and for a moment I gave thanks my first name selection hadn't worked.

There was something off about the mages though—they'd only used Flame Strike the entire dungeon. Nothing else.

I commanded my golems to grab one commander while I got the other, drawing both back toward the edge of the room while the tank pulled the boss back and the mages started their Flame Strike barrage.

A perfect pull. It took nearly five minutes for the others to down the boss, and I'd almost finished with the commanders. My Poison Arrow did one percent of the target's life every second plus its initial strike. Both commanders were nearly depleted after I finally got the second one to attack the golems.

Mikia was perfect on the healing. She only had two spells—a big heal and a single-target heal over time effect. The slow regeneration was enough to keep the golems alive, only recasting them once after a tag-team special by the commanders brought them very low.

**[Level Up]** **[Level 11]**  
**[Level Up]** **[Level 13]**

Mikia and I both got notifications at the same time when the last monster fell. She was startled—from experience, she knew it should have taken her almost this whole dungeon to level up, but she'd made it at boss one of three. She gave me a questioning look, but I shook my head and glanced at the others.

Not now. She understood.

"You've got the skills, rookie, even if you are underleveled," the tank congratulated me.

"Thanks. In here I'll level up fast—everything's way over my level, so it gives extra experience."

The others got ready to head for the second boss.
