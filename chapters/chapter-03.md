# Chapter 3: Finding Home

Selling everything was quick and easy—there's a shop right by the dungeon that buys whatever you bring out and sells beginner potions too. Finding a place to sleep proved way more difficult.

Hotel space was basically nonexistent. Only the expensive ones had rooms left, and at six silver a night with meals, that was brutal on my budget.

"That's half what I made today," I muttered, checking my coin purse. "Maybe I can find somewhere cheaper?"

A pedestrian overheard me and pointed toward a sign on a nearby wall: 'Private rooms for rent long term. Furnished. 5 silver a month, privy and hearth.'

I had the silver. For a whole month? That wasn't a bad deal at all.

The address led me to a run-down apartment building that looked like an abandoned Motel 6 from back home. This world didn't paint much—stone if you could afford it, dark brown stain if you couldn't. No faded yellow paint here, but it still had that roadside motel vibe.

Heavy brown stain flaked off the building in chunks. Clearly applied by someone who didn't give a damn. But it had rooms, and that was what mattered right now.

I spotted a food market at the end of the street as I approached. That was convenient. Maybe these places wouldn't be too bad.

The manager took me to an open unit—a single room roughly ten by fifteen feet. Part of the space was taken up by a small bathroom with a flush toilet and sink. Hand pump for water, so no running water. Manual refill to flush.

Along one wall sat a long stone bench with an old wooden chair and a fireplace taking up the middle section. They weren't joking about the hearth part. The cooking setup was basically the fireplace, with a pot hanging over the opening and a stand with a wok off to the side.

Primitive by my standards, but I'd cooked over campfires before. I could make this work until I could afford better. I'd seen magic-fired stoves in the street vendor stalls that looked like my grandma's old wood stove, and the restaurant had a modern-looking grill that might also be magic powered.

Not all hope was lost.

I handed the manager my silver, and he pointed out back. "There's firewood there. I brought in the first batch, you can fetch the rest." He left me with the key to my new apartment.

"It's got a bed with decent blankets, a couch, a table and a chair. Covers the essentials." I sighed, looking around. "If nothing else, it'll motivate me to do better in life."

And motivate me it did. The bed was hard as a rock, so I ended up sleeping on the old couch instead. Maybe I could find a decent futon in the shops tomorrow. I'd always preferred a futon on the floor anyway—better position for all-night VR gaming without risk of falling.

Waking up early to light the fire—a technique I still remembered from grandma's stove—I headed to the market while the pan heated up.

Tea, oil, peanut butter, a dozen eggs, rice, vegetables, and a big bag of dried ramen-style noodles. All for under ten copper. Food was cheap here, I decided. I added a small fish from a returning fisherman and some freshly baked buns.

Peanut butter sandwiches and deluxe ramen during the day, eggs and rice with hopefully that fish for breakfast. The only things I actually knew how to cook. I was going to have to either eat out or learn to cook—my limited skills didn't exactly lead to a buff physique in my last life.

The fish proved edible even with my questionable cooking skills. I packed peanut butter buns into my storage for snacks and found a worn water skin in the cupboard by the plates. It was beat up but functional.

"Poor adventurer mode engaged," I told myself as I headed out the door.

"If I can do two dungeons today, I can get a good meal at that diner to celebrate." I was about to get in line when I saw a short sword for sale at the trade shop. The stats showed way more damage than my bat, so after some haggling and the last of my coin, I was ready with a weapon upgrade.

Both runs proved much easier. Fast enough that I could squeeze in a third run. I returned to the vendor exhausted at the end of the day.

"Hard work clearing the dungeon. Good work, son. Total is seventeen silver, nineteen copper." 

Twenty-five copper to a silver—weird number, but who was I to set exchange rates?

The lantern burning in front of the cafe was like a beacon by this point. The extra run had long since depleted both my food storage and my energy.

"I'll take the dinner special with coffee, please!" I called to the waitress before I could even find a table.

"We've got bandages if you need them," she smiled, bringing over my coffee.

"No, I should be fine. Down to just scratches at this point." I smiled back and she hurried off to get my food.

I looked up at the board to see what I'd ordered. 'Dinner Special: Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes.' The sign was permanently smudged and repaired, showing this had been the special for a long while.

Four copper with free coffee refills was definitely worth it, judging by the mountain of food she set in front of me.

"Time to check my status," I grumbled, shoveling food into my mouth.

"It's not much, but I'm getting there."

A group of warriors and a mage were talking about the second dungeon while smoking outside the cafe. I listened in—they said drops in the second dungeon went for up to a silver each, potentially a hundred silver total per run. That sounded almost too good to be true, but it gave me a plan.

Get some armor to replace these starter robes and hit level 10 as quickly as possible. If a few warriors and a mage could do it, so could I. I had golems, after all.

What I didn't know was that their tank was actually a paladin, not a warrior. I couldn't tell the difference from their armor.
